🐾 AdoptNest – Pet Adoption Management System
📌 Project Overview

AdoptNest is a web-based pet adoption management platform designed to simplify and streamline the pet adoption process. It serves as a centralized hub where adopters can discover pets, view detailed profiles, submit adoption requests, and track application status. Pet providers (shelters, rescues, or individuals) can manage listings, update health records, and connect with adopters easily.
The system promotes responsible and ethical pet adoption by ensuring transparency, maintaining complete medical and vaccination records, and improving communication between adopters and providers.
